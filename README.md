# âš¡ Firestarter API
Firestarter's lightning fast web API! Uses Node.js, Express, and Mongoose to allow for lightning fast content delivery.

The API is currently in progress and only has basic endpoints. The plan is to have a full, production-ready API to aid in Firestarter's operations, both web and in-game!
